# let the water hold me down
I will _try_ even when I fully expect to fall flat on my face. As I fail I will _learn_ and through this struggle I will _grow_.

Build. Build. Build. I will _build_ my way out of this place. 
Build. Build. Build. I will _build_ when I don't see a way. 
Build. Build. Build. I will _build_ until I'm not afraid.

I will _always_ ask questions when I don't _understand_. I will _document_ where I found none.

There is __strength__ within - _water flowing underground_.
